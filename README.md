# deepleraning.ai
This is some records of Andrews' `deeplearning.ai` course from `Coursera`. I have uploaded my programming implement to this warehouse. There might be something wrong with my work, be free to email `qannafalsahmi@gmail.com`. And if you can push your right answer, that will be grateful.<br/>
And to be clear, Ng's course is my first access to AI. I would love to share more learning experience on DL/ML, so I will put some good repos/articles on this page. Please read this whole `REDEME`, hope there is some thing helps you. <br/>
